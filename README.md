# CoreImageProcessor

An WPF image manipulation UI for a C#/.Net Core cross-platform image manipulation library, which I wrote for a university course. Additionally, I added partial C++ NVIDIA CUDA Support to explore GPU acceleration of long running, CPU-bound tasks. This was a lasting experience as it was a great introduction to GPU acceleration in general.
